This one is to try to wire up a react-based client with sequelize providing the
data. I created it with `npm init vite@latest` and chose native javascript and
react, then I added react-router, sequelize and sqlite dependencies.

we'll copy the page from the electron_app project and convert them to react
components
then we'll copy the sequelize models and helpers from the sequelize demo folder
and wire them to react somehow
